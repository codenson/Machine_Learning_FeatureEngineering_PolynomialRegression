## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to implement multiple linear regression using gradient descent. The dataset consists of housing features such as size, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and age of the home, with the target being the price of the house.

---

## Features

- **Gradient Descent Implementation**: Optimizes weights and bias for linear regression.
- **Cost Function**: Computes the mean squared error for the model.
- **Prediction Functions**: Predicts target values using both loops and vectorized operations.
- **Custom Visualization**: Uses a custom Matplotlib style (`deeplearning.mplstyle`) for consistent and clean plots.
